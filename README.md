# DesignPatternSuperHeroUniverse

I want to do a reenactment of a popular games series I played when I was a kid:
Final Fantasy. The theme of the story will follow around three characters (heros).
As they take on I will use a builder pattern that will create my base party and 
the villians. I will use decorator pattern to add new abilities/powerups when a party 
member has a significant xp they will level up and may powerup every once in a while.
